# Beginner-Password-Cracker
This is a basic password cracker that is able to crack one word passwords. 
This is super basic and done in Python. It is to help me get started on learning about security tools and familiarizing myself with them.
I had used a tutorial I found online to create this simple cracker. 
I hope this can teach me skills to create even more complex and helpful security tools in the future.
